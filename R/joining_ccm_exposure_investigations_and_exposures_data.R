#' Joining CCM exposure investigations and exposures data
#'
#' This function takes the clean CCM exposure investigations transmission data,
#' the clean CCM exposure invesstigations acquisition data, and the clean
#' CCM exposures data and joins it together via the exposure. Note, we are using
#' other functions within to first join the exposure investigations data and
#' filter it.
#'
#' @param clean_ccm_exposure_investigations_transmission_data A `tbl_df` of our
#' cleaned CCM exposure investigations - transmission data.
#' @param clean_ccm_exposure_investigations_acquisition_data A `tbl_df` of our
#' cleaned CCM exposure invesetigations - acquisition data.
#' @param clean_ccm_exposures_data A `tbl_df` of our cleaned CCM exposures data.
#'
#' @return A `tbl_df` of joined CCM exposure investigations and CCm exposures
#' data.
