#' Filtering CCM exposure investigations data
#'
#' This function takes the joined CCM exposure investigations data and removes
#' loops, i.e., instances where a transmission exposure investigation and
#' an acquisition exposure investigation with the same investigation number are
#' joined. It also removes instances where the transmission exposure
#' investigation and acquisition exposure investigation exposure windows did
#' not overlap.
#'
#' @param join_ccm_exposure_investigations_data A tbl_df of joined CCM
#' exposure investigations data.
#'
#' @return A tbl_df of filtered CCM exposure investigation data.
