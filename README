This R project takes Case and Contact Managment (CCM) data and produces a COVID-19 network. Specifically, we generate the potential transmission networks of COVID-19 in cases and contacts using directed graphs.

The intentions of the project are to automate the process and to make dissemination of the product easier. We used the drake package to manage our workflow as there is quite a bit going on in terms of data cleaning and analysis with multiple datasources. we also use the renv package to capture the packages versions being used to ensure long-term stability of the report.

We take data from the exposure investigations with investigations report type in CCM and filter to include only cases with a transmission exposure mode and then join this on exposure name to a similar extract that only includes cases or contacts with an acquisition exposure mode. Exposure information is then joined to this data, again on exposure name. We remove edges where the transmission exposure investigation and the acquisiton exposure investigation have the same investigation number (loops), edges where the interval between the beginning and end date of exposure contact for the transmission exposure investigation does not overlap the interval between the beginning and end date of exposure contact for the acquisition exposure investigation, and edges where the acquisition exposure investigation has an onset outside the 1 to 14 day incubation period with respect to the beginning and end date of exposures contact.
